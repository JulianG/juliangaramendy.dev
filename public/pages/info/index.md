**Hello! My name is Julian.**  
**I'm a software engineer working with web technologies since 2001.**

![keyboard](./images/keyboard.jpg)

I apply fundamental design principles and best practices to write well-architected code that expresses intention, is easy to understand, maintain and scale, and is properly tested.

I usually work with:  
**React, TypeScript, Next.js, Jest, React Testing Library.**  
**REST, Node.js.**  
**Git, GHActions.**

I also have experience with:  
**Angular, C++, C#, Python, ActionScript, PHP**  
**JSON-RPC, SVN.**  
**Cicle CI, Travis CI**

I'm currently working at **[Wise](https://wise.com)** as a front-end engineer.

I've finally started writing a blog: [I Have To Write This Down](/blog).

My [GitHub profile](https://github.com/JulianG/) is here.
